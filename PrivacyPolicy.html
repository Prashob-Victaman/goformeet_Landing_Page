      <h1 class="privacy-heading">Why do we collect personal information?</h1>
      <p class="privacy-description">
        In this Privacy Policy, your "Personal Data" means information or pieces of information that could allow you to

        your interests, philosophy, work and basic information about yourself (such as your age, height, religion,
        ethnicity, place of residence etc). We will process this data.
      </p>
      <p class="privacy-description">

      <p class="privacy-description">
        We will only share your Personal Data with other users, and only what is necessary to assess if another user
        could be interesting for you – which will be clarified below.
        ‍</p>
      <p class="privacy-description">
        We will only disclose your Personal Data to third parties if there is a legal obligation to do so by a statutory
        authority from the appropriate jurisdiction. We do not sell your Personal Data to third parties.

      <p class="privacy-description">

        basis of age, religion and other information that users share on their accounts. Once you have created Your
        Account, the data you have shared with Facebook or Linkedin will also be linked to Your Account. If other users
        have also used Facebook Login and have enabled Facebook Folio, you can see which mutual connections you and
        other users have. We advise you to be careful with sharing information on Your Account with other users.

        select a display picture for your account. We may use an external face recognition tool and other techniques to

        composition and authenticity. Images uploaded by you may be modified by us to make them more presentable on the
        platform. New pictures uploaded by you will be reviewed before they appear on Your Account. The pictures that

        We try our best to ensure that your Personal Data is protected and secure from unauthorized or unlawful access,

      <p class="privacy-description">
        Your personal data may be hosted by our storage partners in servers located in countries other than your country
        of residence.
      </p>
      <p class="privacy-description">
        You can also view, edit or delete your Personal Data by logging in to your Goformeet account. To protect loss of
        data due to natural disasters and other such unforeseeable circumstances, we store your details as backup for a
        safety retention window of upto three years following account deletion. During this period, account information
        will be retained although the account will of course not be visible on Goformeet anymore.
      </p>
      <p class="privacy-description">
        When you delete your account, your personal data is deleted after this retention window. We only retain your
        email address and phone number in order to be able to contact you with regard to payment matters. For internal
        use, we may store generic, non-personal data regarding your activity as a user (number of people invited, number
        of logins, term of your subscription, payment method, etc).

        Goformeet shall not collect data from minors. Should a Member lie about his/her date of birth, and particularly

        Goformeet of this by sending an e-mail to info@Goformeet.co, requesting the data to be deleted. Goformeet
        commits to deleting all data on the minor in question as soon as possible.
